<i>New WiFi Pineapple Pager</i>
</p>

The first Payload-powered WiFi Pineapple is here — and it runs DuckyScript™, Hak5’s simple and powerful scripting language. Paired with Bash and backed by Linux, it brings serious scripting power to the palm of your hand.

Launch targeted attacks or set alert payloads to fire off based on live WiFi activity. Ringtones, vibes and visuals.

Take control of the airspace with the 8th generation PineAP engine — now over 100× faster. Rebuilt from the kernel up, this attack suite is hyper optimized for advanced WiFi operations, even in the most crowded RF environments.

Run Rogue AP, Man-in-the-Middle, and Deauth attacks. Nab handshakes, OSINT and more, all from a live dashboard.
